Emotional Release and Reprogramming the Subconscious Mind

Is there anything you want to change about yourself? Maybe you have had anxiety your whole life, suffer from a phobia, maybe you have an addiction you are trying to get over, depression, pent up anger, low self esteem. It might seem like, "That is just who  I am, I'll never get over it." But that just isn't true! You can be the person you've always longed to be. Your TRUEST SELF. In a session with Julia, she uses techniques to communicate with your subconscious mind to find out what programs you are running on, release trapped emotions, and set up new programs that will lead you to living your best life. If you are open and willing to be healed, this method WILL work for you.
